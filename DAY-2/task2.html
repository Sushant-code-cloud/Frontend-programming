    <ul>
        <li>The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML</li>
        <li>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.</li>
        <li>HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior to our web pages. </li>
        <li>DOM can be thought of as a Tree or Forest</li>
        <li>Documents are modeled using objects, and the model includes not only the structure of a document but also the behavior of a document and the objects of which it is composed of like tag elements with attributes in HTML.</li>
        <li>we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes, or Elements using commands or methods provided by the Document object.</li>
        <li>It is called a Logical structure because DOM doesn’t specify any relationship between objects. </li>
        <li>DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects.</li>
        <li>Javascript interprets DOM easily i.e javascript can not understand the tags in HTML document but can understand object h1 in DOM</li>
        <li>Javascript can access each of the objects (h1, p, etc) by using different functions.</li>
        <li>Methods of Document Object:

            write(“string”): Writes the given string on the document.
            getElementById(): returns the element having the given id value.
            getElementsByName(): returns all the elements having the given name value.
            getElementsByTagName(): returns all the elements having the given tag name.
            getElementsByClassName(): returns all the elements having the given class name.</li>
        <li>Properties of DOM
            Window Object: Window Object is always at top of the hierarchy.
Document object: When an HTML document is loaded into a window, it becomes a document object.
Form Object: It is represented by form tags.
Link Object: It is represented by link tags.
Anchor Object: It is represented by a href tags.
Form Control Elements:: Form can have many control elements such as text fields, buttons, radio buttons, and checkboxes, etc.
